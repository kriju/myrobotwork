*** Test Cases ***
Execute single commmand
    ${result}=    Execute command    ${LS}

Executing multiple commands
    [Documentation]   Since each Execute command is executed in separate
    ...    session, using `cd` between `ls` calls has no effect on results.
    ${result1}=    Execute command    ${LS}
    Execute command    cd /
    ${result2}=    Execute command    ${LS}
    Should be equal    ${result1}    ${result2}

All return values of execute command
    [Documentation]   To return stderr or rc with execute command, use corresponding
    ...   named argument, where the argument value may be any non empty string.
    ${stdout}    ${stderr}    ${rc}=
    ...    Execute Command    ${LS}   include   return_stderr=yes    return_rc=sure
    Should be equal    ${stderr}    ${EMPTY}
    Should be equal as integers    ${rc}    0

Command in session
    [Documentation]    Write and Read keywords operate on same session, so
    ...    state between keyword calls is preserved.
    Write    ${LS}
    ${result1}=    Read until prompt
    Write    cd /
    Read until prompt
    Write    ${LS}
    ${result2}=    Read until prompt
    Should not be equal     ${result1}    ${result2}
